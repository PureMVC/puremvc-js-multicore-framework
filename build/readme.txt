Building the project and documentation.

Ant and Google Closure compiler are required to build the project files.
Once you have downloaded and installed closure compiler 
(http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/), you should be able to run the Ant
task to generate the library files.

JsTestDriver is used to run unit tests. This project used the JsTestDriver
plugin for Eclipse, but you may be able to run the tool from the command line
if this suits you better. For more information, please visit 
http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/

Documentation is generated with JsDuck (https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck).
Once installed, run makeDoc.sh to build the documentation.
