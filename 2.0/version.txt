Version 2.0

This port is inspired originally from PureMVC for AS3 multicore port and the
Objs standard port respectively by Cliff Hall and Frederic Saunier.
The source classes are in separate files mirroring the original and the
minified library is about 9K. The minification is brought to this port using
YUICompressor.

Usage

As this port depends on the Objs library you may want to start by reading the
"Objs library documentation":https://github.com/tekool/objs/wiki.

Optional

The only thing you may know which is specific to this port (gratefully to
namespaces) is that you can hide the PureMVC classes from the global (the
window object in most cases) context. 

This can be made by setting a HidePureMVC property to true before loading the
port.

Example:

<script type="text/javascript">HidePureMVC=true</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib/objs-2.1.1.js"></script>

This made classes from the PureMVC framework will not pollute the global
context and can only be accessed through their namespace.

Build

To build the project you'll need "Ant":http://ant.apache.org/ to run the
/build/build.xml file located in the build YUICompressor. The task concat all
the JavaScript files in one, next compress and minify it. The YUICompressor
munge option is activated.

The Ant task need both
"YUICompressor":http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/#yuicompressor and 
"YUIant":http://www.ubik-ingenierie.com/miscellanous/YUIAnt/. Respective jar
file for both library need to be copied in the /build/lib/ folder for the task
to run correctly.

Unit Tests

Unit Tests follow the PureMVC for AS3 multicore port with some specific
additions for the JavaScript language.

Unit tests are built upon
"YUI Test Standalone Library":http://yuilibrary.com/yuitest/.

The tests run by opening the /index.html. The test runner and Unit Test
framework loads all the libraries it needs from the /lib/yuitest folder. They
were first built upon YUI 3.2.0 and YUITest 1.0.0 b1 standalone libraries.
