1.0   Original Objs-Based version written by Frederic Saunier. 

	  Objs is available here: http://code.google.com/p/objs/ 
	  The Objs-based port is still available here: 
      http://svn.puremvc.org/PureMVC_JS/branches/objs-based-port
      http://trac.puremvc.org/PureMVC_JS/browser/branches/objs-based-port
      There is a demo here: http://trac.puremvc.org/Demo_JS_EmployeeAdmin
      
      This port unfortunately suffered from lack of documentation and too 
      much intrusiveness of the Objs framework (used to simulate classes and
      interfaces) into the implementation code developers have to write. 
      
2.0   This is a completely new port made from the AS3 Standard version,
      which more closely adheres to the reference port and contains 
      full documentation, and a demo called BoxSplash. It is based on the
      popular MooTools library for implementation of class relationships.
      MooTools is widely used and well documented as is this port
      based upon it. The source classes are in separate files mirroring
      the original and the single compiled class library is about 44k. 
      There is a minified version included (using YUICompressor with -nomunge) 
      that is only 8k.
