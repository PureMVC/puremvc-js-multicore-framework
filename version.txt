1.0   Original Objs-Based version written by Frederic Saunier. 

      Objs is available here: <http://code.google.com/p/objs/>
	    The Objs-based port is still available here:
      <http://svn.puremvc.org/PureMVC_JS/branches/objs-based-port>
      <http://trac.puremvc.org/PureMVC_JS/browser/branches/objs-based-port>
      There is a demo here: <http://trac.puremvc.org/Demo_JS_EmployeeAdmin>
      
      This port unfortunately suffered from lack of documentation and too 
      much intrusiveness of the Objs framework (used to simulate classes and
      interfaces) into the implementation code developers have to write. 
      
2.0   This is a completely new port derived from the MooTools port by
      Justin Willaby (which was itself derived from the AS3 Standard 
      version, and so more closely adheres to the reference port), and then
      reworked for use with ExtJS by Tony DeFusco. Full documentation and
      a demo called BoxSplash are available. Support for class relationships is
      provided by the ExtJS Core library, which is used by the widely 
      popular ExtJS widget library. The source classes are in separate files 
      mirroring the original and the single compiled class library is about 48k. 
      There is a minified version included (using YUICompressor with -nomunge) 
      that is only 10k.  ExtJS Core <http://www.sencha.com/products/core/>

2.0.1 Maintenance release.  Unit tests added.  Fix for defect discovered
      in MacroCommand.js in which the internal array of subcommands was not being
      reinitialized with the construction of each new instance.
