1.0.1   Exposed the previously internal puremvc.declare() for use by 
	  developers. puremvc.declare() allows you to declare a namespace, 
	  and optionally make an Object the referent of that namespace 
	  (e.g., a set of notification constants). puremvc.declare() is also 
	  used by puremvc.define() to automatically declare namespaces from 
	  class definitions.
	  
	  Also we made the decision to disallow null multiton keys. In the 
	  original ActionScript, this is never a problem, but in JavaScript
	  contention could arise if multiple apps by different vendors appear 
	  in the same page and both call Facade.getInstance() without a 
	  multiton key. 
	  
1.0   Initial version of Javascript native port on PureMVC.org. 
      Does not require or depend on any class emulation library.
      
      This port is an summation of three separate JS native ports 
      that were created around the same time. The goal was to use
      the very best implementation of each method in each 'class'.
      
	  David Foley took the reigns of the project doing the 
	  integration, documentation, and testing and will carry on
	  as the official project owner.
