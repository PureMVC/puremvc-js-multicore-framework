1.0   Initial version of Javascript native port on PureMVC.org. 
      Does not require or depend on any class emulation library.
      
      This port is an summation of three separate JS native ports 
      that were created around the same time. The goal was to use
      the very best implementation of each method in each 'class'.
      
	  David Foley took the reigns of the project doing the 
	  integration, documentation, and testing and will carry on
	  as the official project owner.
