## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) JavaScript MultiCore Framework
PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. This is a JavaScript port of the [AS3 reference implementation of the MultiCore Version](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-multicore-framework/wiki). It supports [modular programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) through the use of [Multiton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton) Core actors.

This port contains additional functionality not found in other ports - lightweight JavaScript class-emulation. See puremvc.define() and puremvc.declare() in the documentation for more info. Use of this functionality is entirely optional; you may write classes using the class-emulation provided by other frameworks, if you prefer.

Unit Tests are included in this repository.
