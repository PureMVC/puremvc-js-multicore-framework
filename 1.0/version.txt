Releases

Version 1.0

This port, inspired originally from PureMVC for AS3 multicore port and the
Prototype single core ports respectively by Cliff Hall and Frederic Saunier.
Support for class relationships is provided by the Prototype Core library.
The source classes are in separate files mirroring the original and the
minified library is about 8K. The Minification is brought to this port using
YUICompressor.

This is the first official JavaScript multicore port.

Build

To build the project you'll need "Ant":http://ant.apache.org/ to run the
/build/build.xml file located in the build YUICompressor. The task concat all
the JavaScript files in one, next compress and minify it. The YUICompressor
munge option is activated.

The Ant task need both
"YUICompressor":http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/#yuicompressor and 
"YUIant":http://www.ubik-ingenierie.com/miscellanous/YUIAnt/. Respective jar
file for both library need to be copied in the /build/lib/ folder for the task
to run correctly.

Unit Tests

Unit Tests follow the PureMVC for AS3 standard port with some specific
additions for the JavaScript language.

Unit tests are built upon
"YUI Test Standalone Library":http://yuilibrary.com/yuitest/.

The tests run by opening the /index.html. The test runner and Unit Test
framework loads all the libraries it needs from the /lib/yuitest folder. They
were first built upon YUI 3.2.0 and YUITest 1.0.0 b1 standalone libraries.
