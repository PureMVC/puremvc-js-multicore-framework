/**
 *
 * A base `Notification` implementation.
 *
 * <P>PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such
 * as the one provided with Flash, and ActionScript 3 does
 * not have an inherent event model.</P>
 *
 * <P>The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists
 * to support event-driven communication between the
 * application and the actors of the MVC triad.</P>
 *
 * <P>Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for Events
 * in Flex/Flash/Apollo. Generally, `Mediator` implementors
 * place event listeners on their view components, which they
 * then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the broadcast of `Notification`s to
 * trigger `Command`s or to communicate with other `Mediators`. `Proxy` and `Command`
 * instances communicate with each other and `Mediator`s
 * by broadcasting `Notification`s.</P>
 *
 * <P>A key difference between Flash `Event`s and PureMVC
 * `Notification`s is that `Event`s follow the
 * 'Chain of Responsibility' pattern, 'bubbling' up the display hierarchy
 * until some parent component handles the `Event`, while
 * PureMVC `Notification`s follow a 'Publish/Subscribe'
 * pattern. PureMVC classes need not be related to each other in a
 * parent/child relationship in order to communicate with one another
 * using `Notification`s.</P>
